Although my specialty is not directly related to programming, already from the third year I had to solve complex problems in MatLab. Matlab is a powerful computing tool for an engineer, but any action in it is performed solely with the help of lines of code, and the more difficult the task, the better you need to know the programming language.

			<blockquote>
"At MPEI we studied theoretical mechanics, strength of materials, materials science, mechanics of liquids and gases, analytical dynamics and the theory of vibrations, structural and computational mechanics..." 
			</blockquote>

After 4 years of undergraduate studies and having defended my first thesis on the topic <i>“Vehicle vibrations when driving on uneven ground”</i>, I continued my postgraduate studies at the Department of Robotics, Mechatronics, Dynamics and Strength of Machines.

He wrote programs in Fortran and Matlab languages, which were intended for modeling the processes of stretching and filling the parachute systems of manned descent vehicles of a new generation.
			<p>
A little later, I started working with large data arrays and wrote a program for analyzing test results. The program compared the simulated release with the real one, determined the speed of opening, filling, acceleration and average speeds at all stages of the flight.

In 2016, my dream came true to work in the space industry 
			</p>
			<p>
I am a strength engineer by profession, so I also dealt with strength in Energia. Basically, strength is now considered by the finite element method in specialized software systems, for example, in Ansys. Such programs have evolved over 40+ years to the point that a simple engineer does not need to know a programming language to perform most tasks. However, in some cases, it is possible to reveal the full potential of the program only by writing a script. Knowledge of the Fortran language was very helpful when I found out that all scripts for Ansys are written in it.

"Energia is a place where the achievement of goals is above all. Therefore, to work here as an engineer, you must be a first-class engineer, be the best!.." 
			</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
I had to become a better engineer. In 2017, I wrote a Master's thesis on the topic <i>"Analysis of the strength and opening of the joint of a manned spacecraft"</i> which I defended with excellent marks and received a master's degree with honors.
 			</p>
			<p>
I thought for a long time where I would like to work after graduation. Energy was a great place to work to gain skills and experience, but because of its geographic location, commuting to and from work took up to half a day's work. A new job seemed to have found me by itself, and even before receiving a diploma, I got a job there for an internship.

Strength Engineer, but that's not all
			</p>
			<p>
"Reliability" is a very colorful company. I came here in 2017 as a simple engineer, and left as a project manager, non-destructive testing specialist, electrostrain measurement expert, office manager, application programmer and, of course, an engineer with vast experience.
			</p>
			<p>
The company is engaged in the examination, repair and modernization of <u>unique</u> equipment, mainly in the heavy engineering industry. Unique because most machines are produced in only a few copies, the failure of even one of them can jeopardize not only the whole enterprise, but the whole industry.
			</p>
			<p>
As a multi-specialist, I conducted expertise, created 3D models, performed calculations, prepared modernization and repair projects, supervised all work and handed over the work. In this rhythm, I carried out various work at more than 20 enterprises, a map of which you can see below.

Having worked in the company for less than six months, having done some interesting work, and having written a couple of scientific articles, I thought about further professional development, my mentor, colleague, doctor of technical sciences Surkov A.I. proposed a dissertation topic that I can write on the basis of the work.

			<p class="size-large" >
Since October 2017, I have returned to the walls of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute
			</p>
			<p>
Some of you may know that in graduate school, in addition to attending classes, many graduate students learn to teach. I already had experience in teaching sopromat for 2nd year students, obtained in the magistracy. But now I had to create a schedule of business trips, work and meetings based on the schedule of the institute. 
			</p>
			<p>
Although there were very few classes, most of them could not be skipped. I remember how I traveled from Rybinsk to Moscow and back for 4 weeks in a row, only to visit a couple in English.
			</p>
			<p>
As a teacher, everything was easier. When it was impossible to come, I conducted a lesson or consultation online. I checked the typical photographs taken on the phone, which were sent to me in VK, advised in messages. It can be said that I put my students "on remote" even before it became mainstream in 2020.

Life does not stand still, and by the middle of 2019, I began to think about my future. I kind of liked what I was doing, but there were practically no prospects for growing. On the other hand, I liked teaching at the institute, helping to solve problems, constantly learning something new. As a result, I was able to find a new company in which I really liked working.

Since 2019, I have been a CAD/CAE Technician in the world's most popular CAD - SOLIDWORKS
			</p>
			<p>
If you do not know anything about the world of CAD, then in a nutshell SOLIDWORKS CAD is a program for creating 3D models and drawings. It is so popular all over the world that for many it is the standard.
			</p>
			<p>
CAE is an add-on that is needed for virtual testing of a 3D model. In simple words - we can check the strength of the part, even without having it in reality. From any material. Compare the same part made of steel, aluminum, gold and
<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantium" target="_blank">adamantium</a>. By that time, I already had a huge experience with CAE modules, so I fit perfectly into the SOLIDWORKS distribution team in Russia.

Until the beginning of 2020, I managed to act as a leading SOLIDWORKS Simulation specialist at the largest events held by partner companies. Conducted several trainings and even attended a technical forum in Cambridge.

			<p>
In the year of digital transformation, when due to an underprepared bat all companies switched to remote work, the company I worked for was no exception and also transferred everyone to remote work. Without leaving the refrigerator, I successfully passed the SOLIDWORKS world certification, receiving two of the two possible Expert level certificates.

Remote work does not have many disadvantages, except for the lack of face-to-face events and the very neighbor who cannot complete the repair in any way. There is free time that used to be spent on the road, new hobbies, new hobbies.

			<p>
<blockquote>
One of my hobbies was the creation of a smart home system. Automation of light, sensors for leakage, movement, opening doors and windows. I talked about this on <u class="text-color-gray"><a   href="../../about/smarthome/" >another page</a></u>.

On YouTube channel <u><a  href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCABEJ-vegBnuLSfBWGyQlvA" target="_blank">Workshop SOLIDWORKS</a></u> my videos are the absolute champions in terms of views. If you really want to get acquainted with my work, then watch a couple of videos, and I will be very grateful for a couple of likes.

In September 2021, I graduated from the MPEI postgraduate course and was awarded the degree of Lecturer-Researcher.

In 2022, Dassault Systèmes, which owns SOLIDWORKS, has suspended user support in Russia. Russia itself is on a direct course of import substitution, which is generally not bad, because it means that we have excellent developers who are able to create a product similar in characteristics to the world leader. But this means that I, as a leading SOLIDWORKS specialist, will soon again need to look for a job where I will develop further
